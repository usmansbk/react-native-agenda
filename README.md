# react-native-agenda (WIP: NOT PUBLISHED)

A React Native `Agenda` component that can display infinite repeating listings

The package is both **Android** and **iOS** compatible.

## Try it out

You can run example module by performing these steps:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:usmansbk/react-native-agenda.git
cd react-native-agenda
yarn
```

```sh
yarn android
# or
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
yarn ios
```

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-native-agenda
```

## Usage

The component is built on top [@shopify/flash-list](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/docs/). I suggest you read their docs for a better understanding of how to customize your Agenda list.
